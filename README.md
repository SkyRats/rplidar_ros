How to run rplidar ros package
=====================================================================
There're two ways to run rplidar ros package

I. Run rplidar node and view in the rviz
------------------------------------------------------------
roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar_s1.launch (for RPLIDAR S1)

You should see rplidar's scan result in the rviz.

II. Run rplidar node and view using test application
------------------------------------------------------------
roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar_s1.launch (for RPLIDAR S1)

RPLidar frame
=====================================================================
RPLidar frame must be broadcasted according to picture shown in rplidar-frame.png

RPLidar Topic
=====================================================================
The node publishes in the **/scan** topic


RPLidar ROS Message
=====================================================================
The message type is **sensor_msgs/LaserScan.msg**

```
# Single scan from a planar laser range-finder
#
# If you have another ranging device with different behavior (e.g. a sonar
# array), please find or create a different message, since applications
# will make fairly laser-specific assumptions about this data

Header header            # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of 
                         # the first ray in the scan.
                         #
                         # in frame frame_id, angles are measured around 
                         # the positive Z axis (counterclockwise, if Z is up)
                         # with zero angle being forward along the x axis
                         
float32 angle_min        # start angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_max        # end angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_increment  # angular distance between measurements [rad]

float32 time_increment   # time between measurements [seconds] - if your scanner
                         # is moving, this will be used in interpolating position
                         # of 3d points
float32 scan_time        # time between scans [seconds]

float32 range_min        # minimum range value [m]
float32 range_max        # maximum range value [m]

float32[] ranges         # range data [m] (Note: values < range_min or > range_max should be discarded)
float32[] intensities    # intensity data [device-specific units].  If your
                         # device does not provide intensities, please leave
                         # the array empty.
```
